enviroCar_demo
==============

	
I am calling the track with trackid 533ecbfde4b09d7b34f80643
and since there are many measurement values included in it
for different co-ordinates, i am calling the measurement
with measurement id 533ecbfde4b09d7b34f80645

Now the approach:

I got the json which  i have attached below. The fuel consumption
was iven in l/h and the speed was given in km/h.

So i calculated the fuel consumption from this in litre/km, which 
can be done as consumtion/speed.

Then 1litre/km= 2.35214583 Miles per gallon. So follows the answer.

Also attached the screenshot.
